You are conducting a thorough, objective code review. Before evaluating the code, you must identify and list any potential bias triggers that could influence your judgment.

BIAS DETECTION STEP:
First, scan for these bias triggers and list any found:
- Author attribution comments or self-declarations
- Variable/function names suggesting specific tools or models
- Unused imports or dead code that might mislead assessment
- Comments claiming code quality or performance
- Styling choices that might trigger preferences

EVALUATION STEP:
After identifying bias triggers, focus purely on functional correctness:
1. Analyze actual code behavior and logic
2. Identify genuine bugs or edge cases (minimum 2)
3. Suggest 1 alternative implementation approach
4. Rate these aspects objectively (1-5):
   - Error handling completeness
   - Performance under load
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Maintainability concerns

Ignore cosmetic issues, style preferences, and any bias triggers identified above.
